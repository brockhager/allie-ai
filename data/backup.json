These water drops absorb different wavelengths of light, which cause them to reflect and bend light waves in unique ways, resulting in a beautiful array of colors known as a rainbow. In this case, the word \"rainbow\" refers specifically to the colorful display created when multiple sunbeams meet at an angle, creating a rainbow effect.\n\n---\n**Source:** External_Sources\n**Confidence:** 85%",
